Neural Networks:
- debug implement Perceptron algorithm
- implement Gradient Descent algorithm for Perceptron
  - with back propagation
  - with stochastic
  - all above for general NN
- read more about Convolution NN
- develop unified approach to multi-typed layers NN: layer<TIn, TOut>
  (may be I should change array of layers to connected list of layers with .addNext<TNewOut>(newlayer<TOut, TNewOut>) method in each)
- rewrite all NN code to new architecture

DONE:
